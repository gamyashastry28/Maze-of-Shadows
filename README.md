## General Information
Maze of Shadows is a prototype of a standard maze game with a twist. You must navigate through the maze and find the exit key but your vision will be restricted to only a small portion of your surroundings. The purpose of this project is to submit a prototype for my final assignment and understand the workings of code.


## Technologies Used
- IDLE Shell - version 3.13.0
- Python - version 3.13.0
- Pygame - version 2.6.1


## Features
Maze of Shadows has the following features
- A key to exit the maze
- Small circle of light for limited visibility
- Three sample levels


## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. This game is just a prototype for an assignment and will not be developed into an actual game.

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- The code for the "Level Complete" could have been worked on longer to make it work.
- The powerups mentioned in my prototype pitch could have been added
- A time limit could have been set.
